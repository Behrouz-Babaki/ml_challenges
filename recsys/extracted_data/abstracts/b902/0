Everyone Worth Knowing is Lauren Weisberger's second novel. Published in 2005, it tells the story of Bette Robinson, a single woman in New York City caught up in the city's party circuit through a new job in public relations. Similar in many ways to her bestselling debut, The Devil Wears Prada, it did not, however, sell as well.
