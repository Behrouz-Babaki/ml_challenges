I've explained how things went through in my life and how I've done it all. I just don't want my fans to come up to me and say all these things saying that famous is the best thing in the world. The popularity is pretty high and I want readers to understand that it is not that way about being a celebrity and not read it all for nothing." The book was listed on the Bestsellers chart at #78 out of 100.[citation needed]The book, in which Cyrus writes about how she is an ordinary girl living her dream life, includes stories, poems, songs, photos and quotations from the Bible.Six more editions of the book have been released since its first release in March 2009.A passage out of the autobiography was noted by the New York Post, as follows "I would never smoke, I always say that for me, smoking would be like smashing my guitar and expecting it to play... I'd never do that to my voice, not to mention the rest of my body" in contrast to her smoking habits which she took up sometime in December 2010.
