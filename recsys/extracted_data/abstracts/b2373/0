Soon I Will Be Invincible is a novel by Austin Grossman. It was published by Pantheon Books and released on June 5, 2007. The novel uses two alternating first person narratives. One narrative is told from the point-of-view of Fatale, a female cyborg who is recruited by the superhero group The New Champions as they investigate the disappearance of superhero CoreFire. The other narrative is told from the point-of-view of Dr. Impossible, a supervillain who possesses super-human strength and intellect and suffers from Malign Hypercognition Disorder ("evil genius" syndrome), as he escapes from jail and makes his thirteenth attempt at taking over the world.It is Austin Grossman's first novel. He was better known as a video game designer but was studying literature. While the book uses characters, settings, and storylines generally associated with comic books and superhero fiction, it is written entirely in prose. The story looks at how superheroes cope with their powers and interact with one another. The potential motivations and perspectives of supervillains are also explored. The book has been variously described as clever, engaging, and funâ€”but overstuffed with comic book tropes. An audiobook was released along with the hardcover and a movie has been in development since 2008.
