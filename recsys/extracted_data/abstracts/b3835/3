Valley of the Dolls is a novel by American writer Jacqueline Susann, published in 1966. The "dolls" within the title is a slang term for pills used only by Susann. The term dolls also represents the women in the novel and their mishandling by the patriarchal world in which they are "played" by and dealt with as mere toys. The term also represents the women's reliance on stimulants and soporifics and how it is reminiscent of children clinging to toy dolls for comfort.Valley of the Dolls was an instant success when it was first published and became the bestselling book of 1966. Since then it has sold more than 30 million copies, making it one of the bestselling books of all time. As the first roman Ã  clef by a female author to achieve this level of sales in America, it led the way for other authors such as Jackie Collins to depict the private lives of the real-life rich and famous under a veneer of fiction.
