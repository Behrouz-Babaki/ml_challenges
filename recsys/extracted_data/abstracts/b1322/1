I Capture the Castle is the first novel by English author Dodie Smith, written in the 1940s when she and her husband (also British and a conscientious objector) lived in California during WWII. She longed for England and wrote of a happier time—unspecified in the novel (apart from a reference to living in the 30's) but probably early in that decade — between the wars. Smith was already an established playwright and later became famous for writing the children's classic The Hundred and One Dalmatians.The novel relates the adventures of an eccentric family, the Mortmains, struggling to live in genteel poverty in a decaying English castle during the 1930s. The first person narrator is Cassandra Mortmain, an intelligent teenager who tells the story via her personal journal—a coming-of-age story in which she is visibly maturing and by the end is no longer a girl but a young woman. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 82 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.
