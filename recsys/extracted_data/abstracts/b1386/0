Ink Exchange is an urban fantasy novel written by Melissa Marr. It is set in the same universe as Marr's previous novel, Wicked Lovely, but is not a sequel; rather, it is a companion novel that focuses on a different set of characters. Though only a companion novel, its plot elements connect chronologically to Marr's following novel, Fragile Eternity.
