Stone Butch Blues is a novel written by transgender activist Leslie Feinberg. The novel won the 1994 Stonewall Book Award. It tells the story of the life of a butch named Jess Goldberg and the trials and tribulations she faces growing up in the United States before the Stonewall riots. Published in 1993, the novel became an underground hit before surfacing into mainstream literature. It is generally regarded as a groundbreaking work on the subject of gender, and is one of the best known pieces of LGBT literature. The novel is also a prominent portrait of butch and femme-culture in the late 1960s as well as a coming of age story of Jess, a Jewish working class butch who runs off from home as teenager and becomes part of gay subculture.
