The SCUM Manifesto is a radical feminist manifesto written in 1967 by Valerie Solanas. It argues that men have ruined the world and that women should overthrow society and eliminate the male sex. "SCUM" stands for "Society For Cutting Up Men" according to Sharon L. Jansen, but whether it was an acronym has been disputed.Reprinted at least 10 times, translated into 13 languages, and excerpted several times, the SCUM Manifesto generated a range of reactions, including that it was utopian, feminist, pre-feminist, crusading, and a call to act; accurate, symbolic, irreverent, funny, outrageous, and extreme; parodic and satiric but not a put-on; witty, shocking, and articulative of rage; nonviolent, a suggestion for retraining of men, a declaration that men would be killed, and a charter for violence; and misandric; and that it sought a women-only world and that it wouldn't be necessary to kill men. The term SCUM was often described as an abbreviation for "Society for Cutting Up Men" but Solanas denied it, although the expanded term appeared on a cover of an edition she self-published. An organization did not exist, other than for one public forum with herself as the only member.The Manifesto was little-known until Solanas attempted to kill Andy Warhol in 1968. This event brought significant public attention to the Manifesto and Solanas herself. While some feminists defended Solanas and considered the Manifesto a valid criticism of the patriarchal order, others, such as Betty Friedan, considered Solanas's views to be too radical and polarizing. Although Solanas's motives for shooting Warhol remain unclear, the Manifesto is still frequently associated with this event.
