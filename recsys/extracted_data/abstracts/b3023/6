The Horse and His Boy is a high fantasy novel for children by C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1954. It was the fifth published of seven novels in the The Chronicles of Narnia (1950â€“1956) and one of four that Lewis finished writing before the first book was out. It is volume three in recent editions, which are sequenced according to Narnia history. Like the others it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions.The Horse and His Boy is the only Narnia chronicle that features native rather than English children as the main characters and the only one set entirely in the Narnia world. It is set during the last chapter of the inaugural The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; that is, during the reign of the four Pevensie children as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The story features two children and two talking horses fleeing north through Calormen to Narnia; while in Calormen's capital city, they discover a raid being planned on Narnia's southern neighbor Archenland.Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year.
