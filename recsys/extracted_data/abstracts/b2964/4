The Gospel According to Jesus Christ (original title: O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo, 1991) is a novel by the Portuguese author Jos√© Saramago. A fictional re-telling of Jesus Christ's life, it depicts him as a flawed, humanised character with passions and doubts. The novel garnered controversy with some critics, especially among the Roman Catholic Church, accusing Saramago of possessing a "substantially anti-religious vision". It was also praised by other critics as a "deeply philosophical, provocative and compelling work".
