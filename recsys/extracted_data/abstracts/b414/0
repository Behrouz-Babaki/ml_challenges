Bloomability is a book written by Sharon Creech about Dinnie Doone, a young girl who lives with her semi-nomadic family in the modern day United States of America. She is given the opportunity to attend a boarding school in Lugano, Switzerland, where the majority of the storyline takes place. This school is inspired by The American School In Switzerland, where Creech taught English.The title, "Bloomability", comes from Keisuke, one of Dinnie's friends in the novel. Keisuke is a Japanese student at the school who is just learning English, so "bloomability" emerged as his linguistic concept of the word "possibility".
