Maximum Ride is a series of fantasy young adult novels by the author James Patterson. The series is centered around the adventures of Maximum "Max" Ride and five other characters after their escape from the lab facility known as The School. Their group is labeled the Flock, reminiscent of the fact that each of the main characters are avian-human hybrids, (they have wings) a result from the Flock's past involvement with The School.
