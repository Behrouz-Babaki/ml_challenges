Cloudstreet is a novel by Australian writer Tim Winton. It chronicles the lives of two working class Australian families who come to live together at One Cloud Street, in a suburb of Perth, over a period of twenty years, 1943 - 1963. It was the recipient of a Miles Franklin Award in 1992. A six-episode mini-series for television was subsequently developed and broadcast; however, significant discrepancies exist between it and the novel.As one of the most renowned pieces of Australian literature, Cloudstreet encompasses critical Australian themes of family relationships, finding values within the stimuli of life, being the Aussie battler, etc. Winton was interviewed by the ABC in 2007; in this interview he provided his audience with the reason for writing Cloudstreet. "Cloudstreet was my way to express the importance of all the relationships I had throughout my life in Western Australia. As some of you may have picked up from the setting, I love water; the beach, the rivers and the lakes."[citation needed]
