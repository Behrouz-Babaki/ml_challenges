Vampire Kisses is a series of books written by Ellen Schreiber. Vampire Kisses is about a 16-year-old girl named Raven Madison who is a goth misfit in her brightly colored town. When an old abandoned mansion finally gets new residents, the rumors start to spread. Everyone in the small town Raven refers to as “Dullsville” believes that the new neighbors are actually secret bloodthirsty vampires. Even Raven, who, has always loved vampires since she was little, believes the rumors. But one day, she encounters the attractive yet mysterious Alexander Sterling that lives in the mansion, and feels like he is the only person that actually understands her. The two slowly fall in love, but still the question remains; are the Sterlings really vampires? The first book in the series, Vampire Kisses, was one of the American Library Association's young adult book picks for 2004.
