Metaphysics of War: Battle, Victory and Death in the World of Tradition is a collection of essays by Julius Evola originally published by Integral Tradition Publishing in 2007, and is now in its second edition. The book consists of English translations of essays which Evola published in various Italian periodicals during the 1930s and 1940s. All of the essays deal with the topic of war as viewed from a traditionalist perspective, in which the political goals of a war are considered to be secondary to the warrior's goal of spiritual self-realisation through combat. In particular, Evola focuses on the idea of war as understood in the Catholic, Persian and Vedic traditions. In addition to discussing historical topics such as the Crusades and the concept of Jihad in Islam, Evola also describes his contemporary views of Fascism, National Socialism and the Second World War.
