The Chicago Manual of Style (abbreviated in writing as CMS or CMOS [the version used on its website], or orally as Chicago) is a style guide for American English published since 1906 by the University of Chicago Press. Its sixteen editions have prescribed writing and citation styles widely used in publishing. It is "one of the most widely used and respected style guides in the United States." The CMOS deals with aspects of editorial practice, from American English grammar and usage to document preparation.
