World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War is a 2006 apocalyptic horror novel by Max Brooks. The novel is a collection of individual accounts, where the narrator is an agent of the United Nations Postwar Commission following the global conflict against the zombie plague. Other passages record a decade-long desperate struggle, as experienced by people of various nationalities. The personal accounts also describe the social, political, religious, and environmental changes that resulted from the devastating war.World War Z is a follow-up to his 2003 satirical survival manual, The Zombie Survival Guide, but its tone is much more serious. It was inspired by The Good War: An Oral History of World War Two (1984), by Studs Terkel, and by the zombie films of George A. Romero. Brooks used World War Z to comment on government ineptitude and American isolationism, while also examining survivalism and uncertainty. The novel was a commercial hit and was praised by most critics.Its audiobook version, performed by a full cast including Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, and John Turturro, won an Audie Award in 2007. A film inspired by the novel, starring Brad Pitt, was released in 2013.
