The Rainbow Fish is an award-winning children's book drawn and written by Marcus Pfister, Swiss author and illustrator, and translated into English by J. Alison James. The book is best known for its morals about the value of being an individual and for the distinctive shiny foil scales of Rainbow Fish. DHX Media turned the story into an animated television series of the same name, which has aired on the HBO Family television channel in the United States since 1999.
