The Millennium series consists of three bestselling novels, originally written in Swedish, by the late Stieg Larsson (1954–2004). The two primary characters in the saga are Lisbeth Salander, a woman in her twenties with a photographic memory and poor social skills, and Mikael Blomkvist, an investigative journalist and publisher of a magazine called Millennium. Blomkvist, the character, has a history similar to Larsson, the author. Larsson planned the series as having ten installments, but due to his sudden death, only three were completed and published. They are:The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor, literally, men who hate women) (2005)The Girl Who Played with Fire (Flickan som lekte med elden, literally, the girl who played with fire) (2006)The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest (Luftslottet som sprängdes, literally, the air castle that was blown up) (2007)↑
