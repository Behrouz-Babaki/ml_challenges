Written by humorist Dave Barry and novelist Ridley Pearson, the book is a sequel to their book Peter and the Starcatchers, continuing the story of the orphan Peter and his latest adventures with the Starcatchers. Another book, Peter and the Secret of Rundoon, continues the "Starcatchers" series, which serve as a prequel to J.M. Barrie's classic novel Peter and Wendy. It was illustrated by artist Greg Call. Hyperion has also begun a series of chapter books by these creators, which spin off from the series, called the Never Land Books. In May 2008 the writers announced a fourth book: Peter and the Sword of Mercy.
