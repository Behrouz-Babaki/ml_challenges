Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World (世界の終りとハードボイルド・ワンダーランド, Sekai no owari to Hādo-Boirudo Wandārando = Sekai no owari & Hard-Boiled Wonderland) is a 1985 novel by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. The English translation by Alfred Birnbaum was released in 1991. A strange and dreamlike novel, its chapters alternate between two bizarre narratives — "Hard-Boiled Wonderland" (a cyberpunk-like, science-fiction part) and "The End of the World" (a virtual fantasy-like, surreal part).
