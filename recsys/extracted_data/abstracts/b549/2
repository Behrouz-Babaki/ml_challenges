For the film based on the novel, see Child of God (film)Child of God is the third novel by American author Cormac McCarthy, and was published in 1973. It depicts the life of a violent young outcast in 1960s Tennessee.Though the novel received critical praise, it was not a financial success. Like its predecessor, Outer Dark, Child of God established McCarthy's interest in using extreme isolation, perversity, and violence to represent normal human experience. McCarthy ignores literary conventions – for example, he does not use quotation marks – and switches between several styles of writing such as matter-of-fact descriptions, almost poetic prose, and colloquial first-person narration (with the speaker remaining unidentified).
