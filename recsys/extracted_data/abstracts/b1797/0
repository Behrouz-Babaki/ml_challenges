My Shit Life So Far is a comedic observational autobiography by comedian and topical panelist Frankie Boyle. The book details Frankie's working class childhood in Pollokshaws in Glasgow to his rampant teenage sex drive, and his first job, working in a mental hospital. In order to avoid obscenity, the word "shit" on the cover was covered by stickers in most bookshops.
