The End of Eternity (1955) by Isaac Asimov is a science fiction novel, with mystery and thriller elements, on the subjects of time travel and social engineering.The themes are very different from most of his robot and 'space opera' stories, and take a clever approach to time paradoxes. Some consider it his best, or among his best, fiction. As of April 2009, a film adaptation—to be directed by Kevin Macdonald—is planned.
