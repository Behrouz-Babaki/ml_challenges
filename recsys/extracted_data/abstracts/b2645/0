The Bluford Series is a widely read collection of contemporary American young adult novels set in the fictional inner-city high school of Bluford High. The series was created and published by Townsend Press and is co-distributed by Scholastic. As part of an effort to promote reading in underfunded school districts, Townsend Press originally made the Bluford Series available to schools for a dollar each. As of 2012, over 10 million Bluford Series novels were in print.
