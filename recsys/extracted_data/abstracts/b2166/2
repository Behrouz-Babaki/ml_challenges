Rich Dad Poor Dad is a book by Robert Kiyosaki. It advocates financial independence and building wealth through investing, real estate investing, starting and owning businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence. Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly based on Kiyosaki's life. Kiyosaki stresses the ownership of high value assets that produces cash flow, rather than being an employee in the book.
