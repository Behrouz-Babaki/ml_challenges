The Unbearable Lightness of Being (Czech: Nesnesitelná lehkost bytí) is a 1984 postmodern novel by Milan Kundera, about two women, two men, a dog and their lives in the Prague Spring period of Czechoslovak history in 1968. Although written in 1982, the novel was not published until two years later, in a French translation (as L'Insoutenable légèreté de l'être). The original Czech text was published the following year.
