Born Confused is a 2002 young-adult novel by Tanuja Desai Hidier about an Indian-American girl growing up in New Jersey. First published in the United Kingdom on October 1, 2002, it was later released in the United States on July 1, 2003.Hidier wrote Born Confused in 2000/2001, drawing "largely from autobiography." She said in 2006:"I hadn't read any books I could recall with a South Asian American teen protagonist [before I wrote mine] ... To the best of my knowledge Born Confused was the first book with a US female teen desi heroine; that was one of the reasons my publisher wanted it, and it is certainly one of the reasons I wrote it – it was, and is, important to me that a young South Asian American have a voice, and that it be heard and read by people of all backgrounds and ages. And it is just as important that other South Asian American voices be heard; the more out there the more we can begin to approximate expressing the richness and diversity of this culture – the flip side being the fewer out there the more susceptible one becomes to a stereotyping of sorts, to sometimes having to carry the impossible responsibility of representing a culture that is as diverse as the number of people who make it up."An excerpt of Born Confused had appeared in Seventeen magazine in 2002. Hidier was subsequently contacted by book packaging company 17th Street Productions (now called Alloy Entertainment), but she declined their offer to collaborate on an "Indian-American teen story."Hidier had also published a short story called "Cowgirls & Indie Boys" in a 2004 anthology edited by McCafferty called Sixteen: Stories About That Sweet and Bitter Birthday.
