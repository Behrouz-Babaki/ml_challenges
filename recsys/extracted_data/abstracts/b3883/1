Way of the Peaceful Warrior is a part-fictional, part-autobiographical book based upon the early life of the author Dan Millman. The book has been a bestseller in many countries since its first publication in 1980. The book initially had only modest sales, before reportedly Hal Kramer came out of retirement to republish the book, from the H. J. Kramer imprint of New World Library. In early 2006, a film based on the novel, Peaceful Warrior, was released.
