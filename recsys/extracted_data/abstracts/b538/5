Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is a children's book by British author Roald Dahl. It is the sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, continuing the story of young Charlie Bucket and eccentric candymaker Willy Wonka as they travel in the Great Glass Elevator.Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator was first published in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in 1972, and in the United Kingdom by George Allen & Unwin in 1973.Unlike its predecessor, a film version of this book has never been produced. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971) disappointed Dahl to the point that he refused to have a film version produced, while Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have announced that they have no intention of producing a sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, although elements from Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator are seen at the end of the film.[citation needed]Dahl had intended to write a third book in the series but never finished it.
