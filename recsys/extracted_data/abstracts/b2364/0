Son of a Witch (ISBN 0-06-074722-6) is a fantasy novel written by Gregory Maguire. The book is Maguire’s fifth revisionist story and the second set in the land of Oz originally conceived by L. Frank Baum. It is a sequel to Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West (1995). Like Wicked, Son of a Witch differs from the original series in tone: while Baum's books were intended as children's literature, Son of a Witch elaborates a darker and more mature side of the lighthearted world of Oz. In an interview that is included with the Son of a Witch audio CD, Gregory Maguire gave two reasons for writing the book: "the many letters from young fans asking what happened to Nor, last seen as a chained political prisoner, and seeing the Abu Ghraib torture photographs." Son of a Witch continues the story after the fall from power of the Wizard of Oz and the death of Elphaba, Maguire's reinvention of the Wicked Witch of the West. As its title implies, it follows the life of Elphaba’s possible son, Liir.Son of a Witch is the second novel in The Wicked Years. It is dedicated to the musical cast of Wicked.
