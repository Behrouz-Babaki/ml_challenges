A Handful of Dust is a novel by English author Evelyn Waugh, published in 1934. It is included in the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels, and was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the one hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to present. Much of the raw material for the novel came out of his journey to British Guiana and Brazil in 1933 and 1934, which also gave rise to his classic travel book, "92 Days".The title is a reference to a line from the poem The Waste Land (1922), by T. S. Eliot:I will show you something different from eitherYour shadow at morning striding behind youOr your shadow at evening rising to meet you;I will show you fear in a handful of dust.Waugh originally titled the novel A Handful of Ashes, but after a dispute with his American publishers, he chose the quotation from The Waste Land.
