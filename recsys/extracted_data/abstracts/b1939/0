The Original Shannara Trilogy consists of the first three Shannara novels (The Sword of Shannara, The Elfstones of Shannara and The Wishsong of Shannara) by Terry Brooks. Though not originally written as a trilogy, the novels were published as The Sword of Shannara Trilogy by Del Rey; however, Terry Brooks' official website lists the books as The Original Shannara Trilogy.
