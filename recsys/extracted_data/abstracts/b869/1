Ender in Exile is a science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card, part of the Ender's Game series, published on November 11, 2008. It is an interquel and occurs between Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead. It could also be considered a parallel novel to the last three books in the Shadow Saga, since the entirety of these books takes place in the span of Ender in Exile. The novel also concludes a story line, and makes several references to events that take place during the Shadow Saga. Ender in Exile begins one year after Ender has won the bugger war, and begins with the short story "Ender's Homecoming" from Card's webzine Intergalactic Medicine Show. Other short stories that were published elsewhere are included as chapters of the novel.
