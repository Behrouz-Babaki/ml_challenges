Lonely Planet is the largest travel guide book publisher in the world. The company was owned by BBC Worldwide, which bought it in 2007 and sold it in 2013 to American billionaire Brad Kelley's NC2 Media for US$75 million (â‚¤51.5 million).Originally called Lonely Planet Publications, the company changed its name to Lonely Planet in July 2009 to reflect its broad travel industry offering and the emphasis on digital products. After Let's Go Travel Guides, it was one of the first series of travel books aimed at backpackers and other low-cost travellers. As of 2010, it publishes about 500 titles in 8 languages, as well as TV programmes, a magazine, mobile phone applications and websites.Lonely Planet is headquartered in Footscray, a suburb of Melbourne, with affiliate offices in London and Oakland, California.The company name comes from a misheard line in "Space Captain", a song written by Matthew Moore and first popularized by Joe Cocker and Leon Russell on the "Mad Dogs & Englishmen" tour in 1970. The actual words are "lovely planet", but Tony Wheeler heard "lonely planet" and liked it.
