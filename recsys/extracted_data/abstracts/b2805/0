The Desire of Ages is a book about the life of Jesus Christ by the Seventh-day Adventist pioneer Ellen G. White. It was first published in 1898. It is part of her five-volume Conflict of the Ages series, a devotional commentary spanning Bible history from Genesis to the second coming of Christ.Originally Ellen G. White wrote the book with a much larger content, but prior to publishing the book was divided into three separate volumes: Desire of Ages, Christ's Object Lessons (strictly on the parables of Jesus) and Thoughts from the Mount of Blessings. The title of the book is drawn from an Old Testament prophecy of Jesus in Haggai 2:7. "And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of hosts." (KJV) The narrative begins with the prophecy that foretells his name, Immanuel, which means, translated literally, "God with us". After this opening, the narrative continues with the birth of Jesus Christ and his life. Subsequently, it relates and interprets his later life and ministry. White gives time and consideration to the life of Christ: to his many miracles, his teachings to his disciples, and his passion, death, resurrection, and ascension.
