Night World is a series of ten (with the tenth as yet unpublished) young-adult fantasy novels by American author L. J. Smith. The series presents a story in which vampires, witches, werewolves, and shapeshifters live among humans without their knowledge. These supernatural races make up a secret society known as the Night World, which enforces two fundamental laws to prevent discovery: 1) Never allow humans to gain knowledge of the Night World's existence and, 2) Never fall in love with a human.Each volume of the series follows a different protagonist (always a teenage girl) who must face various challenges involving love, the "soulmate principle" and the Night World's strict code. In the first six novels, the plot focuses on the protagonist discovering her soulmate and the danger which ensues. In the seventh book of the series, the concept of an impending millennial apocalypse is introduced. Although the theme of the "soulmate principle" continues to be present, the later books' plots focus on the search for four "Wild Powers" who, according to an ancient prophecy, will either save the world or aid in its destruction. Books from the series appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List for children's books in 2008 and 2009.The concluding book in the series, Strange Fate, has been delayed for over a decade, and the release date is currently unconfirmed, with various websites stating different release dates. On January 22, 2012, in response to a fan's question regarding the publication of Strange Fate, the concluding book in the Night World series, L.J. Smith stated on her website "Strange Fate will come out when I'm finished writing it. It is a very, very long book. I promise that I am working on it right now."
