The Things They Carried is a collection of short stories by Tim O'Brien, about a platoon of American soldiers in the Vietnam War. It was first published by Houghton Mifflin in 1990. Many of the characters are semi-autobiographical, sharing similarities with characters from his memoir If I Die in a Combat Zone, Box Me Up and Ship Me Home. O'Brien dedicated The Things They Carried to the men of the Alpha Company with whom he fought during the war.
