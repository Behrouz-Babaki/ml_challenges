The Reagan Diaries is an edited version of diaries written by President Ronald Reagan while in the White House. The book is edited by Douglas Brinkley, while the full, unedited diaries were published in 2009. For eight years as President, Ronald Reagan, regarded by some at the time as one of the least introspective of American leaders, kept regular, dutiful entries in a diary. The edited diaries reached #1 on the New York Times Bestseller List.
