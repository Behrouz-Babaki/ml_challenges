Young Bond is a series of five young adult spy novels by Charlie Higson featuring Ian Fleming's secret agent James Bond as a young teenage boy attending school at Eton College in the 1930s. The series was originally planned to include only five novels; however, after the release of the fifth novel, a second series was considered by Higson as a possibility. In October 2013 it was confirmed that a second series was in development, with the first novel due for release in Autumn 2014, but it would be penned by Steve Cole while Higson continued work on his young adult zombie series, The Enemy.Since the release of the first novel SilverFin in 2005, the series has become very successful and has led to further works including games, a graphic novel and even a supplemental travel guide. The last book, By Royal Command, was published in September 2008.English-language versions of the books are published by Puffin Books in the United Kingdom and Hyperion Books For Children in the United States.
