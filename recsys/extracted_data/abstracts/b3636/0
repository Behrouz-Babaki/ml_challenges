The Walking Drum is a novel by American author Louis L'Amour. Unlike most of his other novels, it is not set in the American West, but is a historical novel set in 12th century Europe and the Middle East.The main character of the story is Mathurin Kerbouchard. In the course of the story he goes around from city to city looking for his father and assumes the roles of slave, pirate, scholar, physician, merchant, alchemist and lover. Kerbouchard becomes a seeker of knowledge and fortune on a journey of challenge, danger and revenge.Along his long journey the main character is thrust into the heart of the treacheries, passions, violence and dazzling wonders of a magnificent time. From castle to slave galley, from sword-racked battlefields to a princess's secret chamber, and ultimately, to the impregnable fortress of the Valley of the Assassins in the heart of Persia.The book is named for a merchant caravan's marching drum, first described in chapter 36: We often sang as we marched, and there was always the sound of the walking drum, a sound I shall hear all my life, so deeply is it imbedded in the fibers of my being... The book is filled throughout with this theme of travel to far lands, as epitomized by the marching of a merchant caravan.Following the end of the novel, Louis L'Amour wrote in the section titled Author's Note, "I am planning to continue Kerbouchard's tale in at least two more adventures during the next few years, the first of which will follow Kerbouchard to Hind (India) in search of Sundari". This sequel was to be entitled "A Woman Worth Having." Book Three of the series would be set in China. In spite of the stated desire by L'Amour, no continuation of this novel was ever published, presumably due to developing health issues, eventually leading to his death four years later in 1988.
