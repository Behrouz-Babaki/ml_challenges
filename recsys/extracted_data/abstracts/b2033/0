It has been translated into 25 languages and appeared on bestseller lists in the U.S., France, and Israel.Plato and a Platypus examines the classic categories of philosophy, with concepts explained or illustrated by jokes.The concept behind the book in the Introduction: “The construction and payoff of jokes and the construction and payoff of philosophical concepts are made out of the same stuff. They tease the mind in the same ways…philosophy and jokes proceed from the same impulse: to confound our sense of the way things are, to flip our worlds upside down, and to ferret out hidden, often uncomfortable, truths about life. What the philosopher calls an insight, the gagster calls a zinger.”
