The Princess Bride is a 1973 fantasy romance novel written by William Goldman. The book combines elements of comedy, adventure, fantasy, romantic love, romance, and fairy tale. It is presented as an abridgment of The Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern (though no such book exists), and Goldman's "commentary" asides are constant throughout. It was originally published in the United States by Harcourt Brace, while in the United Kingdom it was later published by Bloomsbury.It was made into a film of the same name in 1987 by Rob Reiner, and an attempt to adapt it into a musical was made by Adam Guettel.William Goldman said "I've gotten more responses on The Princess Bride than on everything else I've done put togetherâ€”all kinds of strange outpouring letters. Something in The Princess Bride affects people."
