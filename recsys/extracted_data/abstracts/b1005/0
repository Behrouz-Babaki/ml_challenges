Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling is the second autobiography (2001) of wrestler Mick Foley, formerly of WWE and TNA. It details his career from January 1999 until his retirement in April 2000 at WrestleMania 2000. Foley originally professed to prefer this book to his first book, Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks but has since confessed that perhaps the first is the better book.
