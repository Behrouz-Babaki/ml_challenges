More than one hundred full-length BattleTech or MechWarrior science fiction novels have been published by FASA Corporation and later ROC, and have been translated into at least fifteen languages. The novels take place in the fictional BattleTech universe of the 31st and 32nd centuries and can be considered space opera.The first official BattleTech novel was William H. Keith's Decision at Thunder Rift (1986); the last from FASA was Loren L. Coleman's Endgame (2002) which resolved plot lines and character arcs from many previous works. Subsequent publications jump ahead chronologically to the 32nd-century MechWarrior: Dark Age setting, beginning with Michael A. Stackpole's Ghost War (2002) and ending with Kevin Killiany's To Ride the Chimera (2008). The closure in 2008 of WizKids delayed the release of further novels.Catalyst Game Labs received the rights to publish both Classic and Dark Age book lines and has scheduled new works to resume in the fall of 2009. The Dark Age-era series, originally known as Mechwarrior: Dark Age, has been renamed Battletech: Dark Age.
