The concluding Silver on the Tree (1977) also won the annual Tir na n-Og Award.The novel The Dark is Rising features Will Stanton, age 11, who learns on that birthday that he is an "Old One" and thus destined to wield the powers of The Light in the ancient struggle with The Dark. In the U.S. it was a Newbery Honor Book (runner up for the medal). Its 2007 film adaptation, titled The Seeker in America and The Dark is Rising in Britain, made important plot and character changes from the book.
