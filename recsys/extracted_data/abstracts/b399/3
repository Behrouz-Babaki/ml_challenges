Blood Meridian or the Evening Redness in the West is a 1985 Western (or Anti-Western) novel by American author Cormac McCarthy. McCarthy's fifth book, it was published by Random House.The majority of the narrative follows a teenager referred to only as "the kid," with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred Native Americans and others in the United Statesâ€“Mexico borderlands from 1849 to 1850 for bounty, pleasure, and eventually out of sheer compulsion. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by Judge Holden, a huge, intellectual man depicted as bald from head to toe and philosophically emblematic of the eternal and all-encompassing nature of war.Although the novel initially generated only lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since become highly acclaimed and is widely recognized as McCarthy's masterpiece.Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005.
