The Five Thousand Year Leap: Twenty-Eight Great Ideas That Are Changing the World is a book that was published in 1981 by an ex FBI agent and anti-communist as well as conservative Mormon author Cleon Skousen. The book asserts that the United States prospered because it was established upon universal natural law principles passed down from Common Law and traditional Judeo-Christian morality, as many of the Founding Fathers were guided by the Bible among others, and consequently that the U.S. Constitution incorporates enlightened ideas.In Ronald Mann's introduction to the 10th-anniversary edition, he praises Skousen for grasping America's choice of "Christ or chaos" and for acknowledging that America's future depends on "accepting and demonstrating God's government."
