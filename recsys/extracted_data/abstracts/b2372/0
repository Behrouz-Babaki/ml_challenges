Sons of the Dark is a book series that was spun off from Lynne Ewing's best-selling Daughters of the Moon series.This series is about four very different young teenage boys living in Los Angeles. They are all immortal and all four have to try to fit in. Each boy also fights his dark side. They each have different powers and the Sons must complete their destinies and stop the people of Nefandus from invading the Earth's realm. Due to poor book sales, the series has been discontinued. The Sons' fate is told in the last Daughters of the Moon book.
