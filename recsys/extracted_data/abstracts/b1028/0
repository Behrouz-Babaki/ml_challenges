Franny and Zooey is a book by American author J. D. Salinger which comprises his short story "Franny" and novella Zooey /ˈzoʊ.iː/. The two works were published together as a book in 1961, having originally appeared in The New Yorker in 1955 and 1957, respectively. Franny and Zooey, both in their twenties, are the two youngest members of the Glass family, which was a frequent focus of Salinger's writings."Franny" takes place in an unnamed college town during the weekend of "the Yale game" and tells of an undergraduate who is becoming disenchanted with the selfishness and inauthenticity she perceives all around her.Zooey, a somewhat emotionally toughened genius who at the age of twelve had "a vocabulary on an exact par with Mary Baker Eddy's". Whilst Franny, his younger sister, suffers a spiritual and existential breakdown in their parents' Manhattan living room—leaving Bessie, their mother, deeply concerned—Zooey comes to Franny's aid, offering what he thinks is brotherly love, understanding, and words of sage advice.
