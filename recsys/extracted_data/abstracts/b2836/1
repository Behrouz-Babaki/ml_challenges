The Dresden Files is a series of contemporary fantasy/mystery novels written by Jim Butcher. The first novel, Storm Front, was published in 2000 by Roc Books.The books are written as a first person narrative from the perspective of the main character, private investigator and wizard Harry Dresden, as he recounts investigations into supernatural disturbances in modern-day Chicago. Butcher's original proposed title for the first novel was Semiautomagic, which sums up the series' balance of fantasy and hard-boiled detective fiction.As of 2012, Butcher has written 14 novels, plus a number of short stories (some of which are collated in the anthology Side Jobs). The series has also been released in audiobook format, with all but one audiobook read by James Marsters. Other works set in the same fictional universe include graphic novels (two new stories, plus adaptations of the first two novels), and The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game. In 2007, a television series based on the novels aired for one season on the American Sci-Fi Channel.
