Set amidst a series of murders in the American Civil War era, it also concerns a club of poets, including such historical figures as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., and James Russell Lowell, who are translating Dante's The Divine Comedy from Italian into English and who notice parallels between the murders and the punishments detailed in Dante's Inferno.The work reached the top of several best-seller lists (including Borders, Washington Post, and Boston Globe) and also appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List. The plot is largely fictional, although the main characters are real, as are many of their biographical details. Supporting and background characters, as well as those directly involved with the murders, are also mostly fictional.
