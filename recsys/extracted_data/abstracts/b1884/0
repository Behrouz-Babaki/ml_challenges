Number the Stars is a work of historical fiction by Newbery Award award-winning author Lois Lowry. It is about the escape of a Jewish family from Copenhagen during Occupation of Denmark on Second World War because of the Holocaust.The story centers around ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen, who lived in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1943 and was caught up in the events surrounding the rescue of the Danish Jews. She risks her life to help her best friend, Ellen Rosen, by pretending that Ellen is Annemarie's late older sister, who had died earlier in the war as a result of her work with the Danish Resistance. The story's title is taken from a reference to Psalm 147, in which the writer of the book relates that God has numbered all the stars in the universe. This reference is meant to tie into the Star of David, specifically to Ellen's necklace, which is symbolic to the story.The novel was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1990 as the "most distinguished contribution to American literature for children". Lois Lowry traveled to Copenhagen to do research and interviews for the book. She herself took the photo of the girl used for the cover (shown in infobox here). That cover was used on many editions of the book.
