The Gatekeepers: Inside the Admissions Process of a Premier College is a 2002 nonfiction book written by education reporter Jacques Steinberg that examines the inner workings of admissions committees at prestigious colleges and universities in the United States and addresses the changing face of American higher level education in the 21st century. Steinberg was granted access to admissions officers, school administrators, guidance counselors, and high school students and their parents during the writing process. The book itself expands upon a series of articles Steinberg wrote in the New York Times. Steinberg follows the life of a Wesleyan University admissions officer Ralph Figueroa and 6 college applicants through the full college admissions process. The book touches upon such hot button issues such as affirmative action, recruiting, standardized testing and the significance of the SATs. The book reveals that supplementary material in an application carries no weight, but admitting a mistake can be positive.
