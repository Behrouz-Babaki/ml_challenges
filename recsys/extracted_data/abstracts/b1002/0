Flygirl is a super-heroine published by Archie Comics.Kim Brand was an actress rescued by The Fly from a fall from a hotel window in issue #13 of The Adventures of the Fly. Kim fell in love with the superhero. When an enemy of the Fly arranged for two simultaneous crimes, reasoning that the hero could not be in two places at the same time, Turan, one of the Fly People, appeared to Kim in issue #14.Turan, who had granted Tommy Troy the power to become the Fly, gave Kim a ring with a fly-shaped emblem. By rubbing the ring and saying "I wish I were Flygirl," she exchanged bodies with the Fly People's dimension and became a costumed superheroine. To return to her own identity, all she had to do was utter her name.In addition to appearing in the Fly's title, she also appeared in short stories in another Archie title Pep Comics (#153, 155, 156, 158) and Laugh #136, 137, 143).During the "Radio Comics/Mighty Comics" period, Flygirl appeared in both Fly-Man and Mighty Crusaders.Later on, during Archie's Red Circle Comics revival in the 1980s, Flygirl would again appear in both Mighty Crusaders and The Fly.
