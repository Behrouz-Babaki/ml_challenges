Vampirates is a series of books by British author Justin Somper, about two twin children, Connor and Grace Tempest, who get separated at sea and are picked up by two very different ships. The term Vampirate refers to a vampire living on the pirate ship, the Nocturne. Later changed to "Nocturnal" to differ themselves from rebellious and uncontrolled Vampirates.
