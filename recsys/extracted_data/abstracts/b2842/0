The Education of Little Tree is a memoir-style novel written by Asa Earl Carter under the pseudonym Forrest Carter. Since its first publication by Delacorte Press in 1976, the book has been the subject of acclaim. Many people have been drawn to its message of simple living, tradition, and love of nature. However, The Education of Little Tree has also been the subject of controversy after the publication of an article on October 4, 1991, by Dan T. Carter (a history professor and distant cousin of Asa Carter) called "The Transformation of a Klansman" in The New York Times. This article described Asa Carter's past involvement with the Ku Klux Klan.The novel has spawned films, a sequel attempt, and a number of graduate theses and scholarly articles. In 1985, the University of New Mexico Press bought the book's rights. It has since sold millions of copies, a rare level of success for a book distributed by an academic press, and won the 1991 American Booksellers Association Book of the Year (ABBY) award.
