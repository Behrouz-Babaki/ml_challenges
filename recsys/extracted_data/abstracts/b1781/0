My Best Friend Bob is a children's picture book written and illustrated by Georgie Ripper, first published in 2003. Brian and Bob are guinea pigs who live in a cage in Pete's Pet Palace. One day they are cruelly separated, when Bob is sold and suddenly taken away from the pet shop. Brian is inconsolable as he now has no-one to play I-Spy with, and even a peanut can't cheer him up. Misery sets in until he, too, is sold, and the two guinea pigs are reunited in a touching final scene.It was published in the United States under the title Brian and Bob: the Tale of Two Guinea Pigs.
