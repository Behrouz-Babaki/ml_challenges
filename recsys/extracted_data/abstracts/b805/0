Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance is a memoir by Barack Obama. It was published in July 1995 as he was preparing to launch his political career in a campaign for an Illinois office, five years after being elected in 1990 as the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. It covers the events of his life up until his entry into law school.Obama's March 2004 U.S. Senate Democratic primary victory in Illinois led to the book's re-publication in August 2004. This followed by two weeks his July keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention (DNC). Three years later, he would launch his presidential campaign and was elected President of the United States. The 2004 edition included both a new preface by Obama and his DNC keynote address.
