Rubyfruit Jungle is the first novel by Rita Mae Brown, published in 1973. It was remarkable, in its day, for its explicit portrayal of lesbianism. The novel is a coming-of-age autobiographical (some have suggested picaresque) account of Brown's youth and emergence as a lesbian author. The term "rubyfruit jungle" is slang for the female genitals.
