A Man Without a Country (subtitle: A Memoir Of Life In George W Bush's America) is an essay collection published in 2005 by the author Kurt Vonnegut. The extremely short essays that make up this book deal with topics ranging from the importance of humor, to problems with modern technology, to Vonnegut's opinions on the differences between men and women. Most prevalent in the text, however, are those essays that elucidate Vonnegut's opinions on politics, and the issues in modern American society, often from a decidedly humanistic perspective. In January 2007, Vonnegut indicated that he intended this to be his final work, a statement that proved to be correct with his death in April 2007. This stood true until a short-story collection of his unpublished work was published posthumously in 2008 titled Armageddon in Retrospect.
