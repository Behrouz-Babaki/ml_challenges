Summer Sisters (ISBN 0-385-32405-7) is a 1998 novel by Judy Blume. It focuses on the life of two fictional characters, the girls Victoria Leonard (Vix) and Caitlin Somers.Because of its heavy sexual content—including lesbianism—this Blume novel is aimed squarely at an adult audience, not her pre-teen audience for which she gained popularity.
