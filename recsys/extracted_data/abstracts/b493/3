By the River Piedra I sat Down and Wept (Portuguese: Na margem do rio Piedra eu sentei e chorei) is one of Paulo Coelho's most prominent titles. This is the first part in Coelho's trilogy "On the Seventh Day". The other two parts are Veronika Decides to Die and The Devil and Miss Prym. This trilogy is a week in the life of someone ordinary to whom something extraordinary happens. The novel takes its title from the incipit of the famous Psalm 137: By the Rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion (KJV).
