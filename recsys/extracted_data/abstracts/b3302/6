The Pilgrimage (Portuguese: O Di√°rio de Um Mago, "Diary of a Mage") is a 1987 novel by Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho. A parable that explores the need to find one's own path. In the end, we discover that the extraordinary is always found in the ordinary and simple ways of everyday people. Part adventure story, part guide to self-discovery, this compelling tale delivers the perfect combination of enchantment and insight. It is a recollection of Paulo's experiences as he made his way across northern Spain on a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela.
