The Story of B is a 1996 novel written by Daniel Quinn and published by Bantam Publishing. It chronicles a young priest's movement away from his religion and toward the teachings of an international lecturer known as B, expanding upon many of the philosophical ideas introduced in Quinn's 1992 novel Ishmael. The Story of B acts as a spiritual successor to both the novels Ishmael and My Ishmael, also by Daniel Quinn.
