The Stormlight Archive is an ongoing epic fantasy series written by American author Brandon Sanderson. Planned as a ten book series, the first book, The Way of Kings, was published on August 31, 2010 by Tor Books in the United States. The release of the second book, Words of Radiance, was delayed until March 2014 due to Sanderson's commitment to writing the final book of The Wheel of Time.
