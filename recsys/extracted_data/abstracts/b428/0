The Book of Esther is a book in the Ketuvim ("writings"), the third section of the Jewish Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible) and is part of the Christian Old Testament. It tells the story of a Jewish girl named Hadassah and Esther. Esther became queen of Persia and thwarted a plan to commit genocide against her people. Also called the Megillah ('Scroll' in Hebrew), the book is the basis and an integral part of the Jewish celebration of Purim. Its full text is read aloud twice during the celebration, in the evening and again the following morning. Scrolls of Esther traditionally have only one roller on the left side, as opposed to most other Biblical scrolls such as the Sefer Torah, which have two rollers, one on each side.Besides Song of Songs, it is the only book in the Bible that does not explicitly mention God.
