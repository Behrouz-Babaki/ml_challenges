Hope for the Flowers is an allegorical novel by Trina Paulus. It was first published in 1972 and reflects the idealism of the counterculture of the period. Often classed as a children's novel, it is a fable or parable "partly about life, partly about revolution and lots about hope â€“ for adults and others including caterpillars who can read". The two caterpillar heroes, Yellow and Stripe, begin their search for meaning by attempting to climb to the top of a caterpillar pillar only to discover another destiny.The novel has been translated into Spanish, Dutch, German, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Russian and Persian.
