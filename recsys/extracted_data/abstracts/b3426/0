The Science of Mind is a book by Ernest Holmes. It proposes a science with a new relationship between humans and God. Holmes, the founder of Religious Science, originally published it in 1926. A revised version was completed by Holmes and Maude Allison Lathem and published in 1938.Holmes' writing details how people can actively engage their mind in creating change throughout their lives. Explanations of how to pray and meditate, heal oneself spiritually, find self-confidence, and express love led Holmes to believe Religious Science is "a philosophy, a faith and a way of life."
