And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by Agatha Christie. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939 as Ten Little Niggers, after the British blackface song which serves as a major plot point. The title was changed to the last line of the rhyme – And Then There Were None – for the first American edition, which used the original American version of the song. That song title, "Ten Little Indians", was used for some editions, until the Christie estate formally approved the US title of the work.[citation needed]In the novel, ten people who had been complicit in the death(s) of other human beings but either escaped notice or were not subject to legal sanction, are tricked or lured into coming to an island under different pretenses, comprising various different sorts of reasons, mainly for either employment or, for the better off, an unexpected late summer vacation or holiday. Although they are the only people on the island, and cannot escape due to the distance from the mainland and the inclement weather, each guest is killed in a manner seeming to parallel the deaths enumerated in the nursery rhyme.It is Christie's best-selling novel with 100 million sales to date, making it the world's best-selling mystery ever, and one of the best-selling books of all time. (Publications International lists it as 7th best-selling.) The novel has been made into several films and adapted for radio.
