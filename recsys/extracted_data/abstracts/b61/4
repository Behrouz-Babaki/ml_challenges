A Hat Full of Sky is a comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett set on the Discworld, written with younger readers in mind. It is labelled a "Story of Discworld" to indicate its status as children's or young adult fiction, unlike most of the books in the Discworld series. First published in 2004, it is set two years after The Wee Free Men, and features an 11-year-old Tiffany Aching. The book is also a sequel to the Discworld short story "The Sea and Little Fishes", which introduced the Witch Trials and Mrs Earwig. It is followed by Wintersmith.
