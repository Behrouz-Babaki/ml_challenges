This article is a list of fictional characters in the comic book series Scott Pilgrim and the film adaptation Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World by Bryan Lee O'Malley.For the film versions of the characters, O'Malley sent crib sheets that explained backstory, character motivations, as well as events in the book to Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright. Bacall then created a "ten secret things" for each character, according to O'Malley, for fun, and many of the entries were jokes: O'Malley said that the "ten secret things" documents were not intended to be taken seriously as character background.For the heights, O'Malley said that he had created a height chart that may have been printed in Volume 1 but that "it’s not really canon, and I never did one again, and the heights were always very inconsistent." With the exception of five of the characters, O'Malley said that the heights were "always kinda vague. I didn’t pay enough attention to it." In regards to hair colours, O'Malley said that during the development of the book, "the hair colors in the book barely crossed my mind (I just used whatever color seemed nice at the time if I was coloring a cover or illustration). There were no “canon” hair colors in my mind."
