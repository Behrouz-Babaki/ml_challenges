Things Not Seen is a 2000 First person fiction book written by Andrew Clements in which a teenage boy, Bobby, suddenly turns invisible. The story revolves around Bobby as he deals with his 'disease', tries to get back to normal, and even befriends a blind girl. The title is presumably taken from Hebrews 11:1,"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." in the King James Version of the Bible.[citation needed] The book was originally released in 2000 by Philomel Books, an imprint of Penguin Group, but was re-released in 2006 as a platinum edition by Puffin. The platinum edition includes a short interview with Andrew Clements and a redesigned cover.This book was followed by two sequels, Things Hoped For and Things That Are.
