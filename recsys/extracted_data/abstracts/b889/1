Escape from Freedom, known as The Fear of Freedom outside North America, is a book by the Frankfurt-born psychologist and social theorist Erich Fromm. First published in the United States by Farrar & Rinehart in 1941, the book explores humanity's shifting relationship with freedom, with particular regard to the personal consequences of its absence. Its special emphasis is the psychosocial conditions that facilitated the rise of Nazism.
