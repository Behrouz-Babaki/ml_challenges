Erin Hunter is a pseudonym used by the authors Kate Cary, Cherith Baldry, Gillian Philip, Inbali Iserles, and Tui Sutherland, along with editor Victoria Holmes. Each of the authors play a different role: while Holmes creates the storyline of each book, Cary, Baldry, and Sutherland take turns writing the books. Sutherland joined the group later and writes mostly for the Seekers series; she has written fewer Warriors books, with all of them being field guides.In addition, another person who is not an Erin Hunter writes the manga: Dan Jolley. The newest addition to the group is Inbali Iserles, who writes Survivors under the pseudonym as well.
