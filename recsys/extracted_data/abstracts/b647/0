Culture Warrior is a book by Fox News Channel political commentator Bill O'Reilly, published in the fall of 2006. O'Reilly asserts that the United States is in the midst of a "culture war" between "traditionalists" and "secular-progressives". O'Reilly appeared on The Colbert Report to promote the book and revealed he is in the Grand Canyon in the picture on the cover.O'Reilly declares war against "the committed forces of the secular-progressive movement that want to dramatically change America, molding it in the image of Western Europe". The term secular progressive, often abbreviated as "S-P", is used extensively by O'Reilly throughout the book.O'Reilly's S-Ps are virtual socialists who are hostile to Christianity and particular traditional American values, as O'Reilly defines them. Funded by "a few far-left billionaires", he asserts that the S-Ps are implementing change in the United States by dominating major newspapers and network television, through the work of such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union, and by "judicial fiat".In the book's preface, O'Reilly describes himself as "perhaps the most controversial broadcaster in the country". His book garnered chart-topping sales, praise, and criticism.
