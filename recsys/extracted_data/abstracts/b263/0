Arguing with Idiots is a book written by conservative syndicated radio talk show host Glenn Beck, in collaboration with his company, Mercury Radio Arts.The book is formatted as a series of responses by Beck, dressed up in a variation of an outfit worn by the United States' Founding Fathers, to statements made by the "Idiot", played by Beck, apparently dressed in a parody of a military uniform, consisting of a modified Bundeswehr tunic and Soviet visor cap, with an example picture on the front cover. On the back cover are a few of the negative criticisms Beck has accumulated.Among the issues Beck discusses are progressivism in the United States, capitalism, the Second Amendment, as well as education, energy in America, labor unions, illegal immigration, the "nanny state", owning a home, economics, American presidents, universal health care, and the U.S. Constitution.
