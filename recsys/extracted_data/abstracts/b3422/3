The Scarlet Pimpernel is a play and adventure novel by Emma Orczy set during the Reign of Terror following the start of the French Revolution. The title character, Sir Percy Blakeney, represents the original "hero with a secret identity" that inspired[citation needed] subsequent literary creations such as Don Diego de la Vega (Zorro) and Bruce Wayne (Batman).
