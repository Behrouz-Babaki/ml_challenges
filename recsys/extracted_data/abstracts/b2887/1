The Feynman Lectures on Physics is a physics textbook based on some lectures by Richard P. Feynman, a Nobel laureate who has sometimes been called “The Great Explainer”. The lectures were given to undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), during 1961–1963. The book's authors are Feynman, Robert B. Leighton, and Matthew Sands. The book comprises three volumes. The first volume focuses on mechanics, radiation, and heat, including relativistic effects. The second volume is mainly on electromagnetism and matter. The third volume is on quantum mechanics; it shows, for example, how the double-slit experiment contains the essential features of quantum mechanics. The book also includes chapters on mathematics and the relation of physics to other sciences. The Feynman Lectures on Physics is perhaps the most popular physics book ever written. It has been printed in a dozen languages. More than 1.5 million copies have sold in English, and probably even more copies in foreign-language editions. A 2013 review in Nature described the book as having "simplicity, beauty, unity … presented with enthusiasm and insight".In 2013, Caltech made the book freely available, on the web site feynmanlectures.caltech.edu.
