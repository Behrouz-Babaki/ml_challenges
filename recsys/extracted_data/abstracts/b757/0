Disco Bloodbath: A Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland is a 1999 memoir written by James St. James about his life as a Manhattan celebutante and club kid. The book specifically chronicles his friend Michael Alig's rise to fame and his subsequent murder of fellow club kid and drug dealer Angel Melendez. St. James was Alig's mentor in the scene and was familiar with many of its key figures. The memoir was later renamed Party Monster after the motion picture of that name starring Macaulay Culkin, Seth Green, ChloÃ« Sevigny and Marilyn Manson.Disco Bloodbath has since gone out of print and often goes for several hundred dollars in auctions. It was only printed 3 times, in 1999, twice in paperback with different coloured jackets, and once in hardcover. It was re-printed in 2003 under the title Party Monster - The Fabulous but True Tale of Murder in Clubland (ISBN 0-684-85764-2); paperbacks are widely available.
