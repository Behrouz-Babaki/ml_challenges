Kreko Komik Remaja, usually referred to as Kreko, is a Malaysian manga magazine which publishes chapters of manga and occasionally manhwa, translated into Bahasa Malaysia. It is published three times a month - on the 1st, 11th and 21st day respectively . Its recommended retail price (RRP) is RM 4.00 unless there is a "bumper" or special edition issue which has more pages, leading to a higher priced release. The magazine is published by Comics Media, who also publishes other similar manga magazines such as Arena Komik, Comics Weekly (in Chinese) and Manga Boom. Since Manga Boom stopped its publication on the 6th issue, the manga serialized in Manga Boom have instead been brought over to Arena Komik and Kreko.Besides the manga (which makes up the bulk of the magazine), Kreko also has some articles about anime, Japanese artists, Japanese culture, information about Gundam figurines, information about latest movies, as well as news about video games. There is also a section showcasing the art of readers, readers-album-foto and MMS, and reader-contributed comic strips.
