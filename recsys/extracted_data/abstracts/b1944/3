Os Maias: Episódios da Vida Romântica ("The Maias: Episodes of Romantic Life", Maia being the name of a fictional family, although some episodes fit into the history of the real Maia family) is a naturalist novel by Portuguese author José Maria de Eça de Queiroz, also known under the modernized spelling Eça de Queirós.As early as 1878, while serving in the Portuguese consulate at Newcastle upon Tyne, Eça had at least given a name to this book and had begun work on it. It was largely written during his later residence in Bristol, and was first published in 1888.The book largely concerns the life of young aristocrat Carlos da Maia in 1870s Portugal, where along with his friend João da Ega he spends his time making witticisms about society and having affairs. The novel uses the Monarchy's decline in Portugal (late 19th century), as a predominant theme, reflecting its author's own regret at his country's slow decay.The analysis of the book is compulsory for 11th year students in Portugal.
