The Book of Proverbs (Hebrew מִשְלֵי, Míshlê (Shlomoh), "Proverbs (of Solomon)"), is the second book of the third section (called Writings) of the Hebrew Bible. When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became "Παροιμίαι=Paroimiae" ("Proverbs"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was "proverbia", from which the English name is derived.Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a "collection of collections" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium. It is an example of the Biblical wisdom tradition, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct. The repeated theme is that "the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom" . Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life.
