The Firebrand is an 1987 historical fantasy novel by American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set in the ancient Greek city of Troy, the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The Firebrand is written from the point-of-view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, rather than as a sufferer of insanity.The novel has been described as belonging to the genres of revisionist history and feminist literature, and employs themes of gender, religion, and power. Bradley wrote it after the success of her 1983 novel The Mists of Avalon, a re-telling of the Arthurian legend from a female perspective. To appeal to a wider readership, The Firebrand includes fewer elements of fantasy than Bradley's previous works. Her only novel set in ancient Greece, her husband Walter H. Breen helped her research the story.Simon & Schuster released The Firebrand on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it was issued in paperback in September 1988. The Firebrand has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated into at least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.
