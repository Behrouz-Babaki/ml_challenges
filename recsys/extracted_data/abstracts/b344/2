Being and Time (German: Sein und Zeit) is a 1927 book by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger. Although written quickly, and though Heidegger never completed the project outlined in the introduction, it remains his most important work and has profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, particularly existentialism, hermeneutics and deconstruction. The book is dedicated to Edmund Husserl "in friendship and admiration".
