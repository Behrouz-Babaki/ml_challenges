The Betty Crocker Cookbook (10th edition, John Wiley and Sons, 2006) is a general kitchen reference sponsored and written by staff at General Mills, the holders of the Betty Crocker trademark. First published in 1950 as the Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book, the Betty Crocker Cookbook is the flagship book of a large collection of books with the Betty Crocker name and is available in binder, trade paperback and comb-bound formats, as well as several special-interest formats such as bridal, heart health, and breast cancer. It has traditionally made extensive use of photography and charts for easy access to data and technique information. It is sometimes informally known as "The Big Red", a term that General Mills has trademarked.The overall series includes books on subjects such as cooking basics, entertaining, ethnic food, and the like, as well as the Betty Crocker: Kids Cook book and the bilingual English/Spanish Cocina Betty Crocker. In addition, the original 1950 edition and the Betty Crocker Cooky Book have been reprinted as facsimiles.
