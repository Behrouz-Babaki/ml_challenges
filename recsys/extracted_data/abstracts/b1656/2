Malory Towers is a series of six novels by British children's author Enid Blyton, featuring the fictional Cornish seaside boarding school of the same name. In 2009 six more books were added to the series by author Pamela Cox, who has also made additions to Enid Blyton's St Clare's series.The series follows the heroine Darrell Rivers from her first year at Malory Towers to when she leaves. Other characters include Sally Hope (Darrell's level-headed best friend), Felicity Rivers (Darrell's younger sister), Gwendoline Mary Lacey (the form's spoilt martyr), Alicia Johns (sharp tongued, competitive, class joker and intelligent), Mary-Lou (small and timid, but very kind hearted), Irene (scatterbrained music genius), Belinda (scatterbrained artistic genius), Jean (shrewd and straightforward) and Wilhelmina 'Bill' (completely horse-mad).The characters are very similar to the set of characters in the St. Clare's series, which Blyton also wrote.The series is believed to be semi-autobiographical,[citation needed] and the name "Darrell Rivers" is clearly drawn from Blyton's second husband's name, Kenneth Darrell Waters.
