No More Dead Dogs is a novel by Gordon Korman published in 2002. Its title alludes to the fact that many books for children and young adults featuring dogs often have the dog die (such as Old Yeller or Where the Red Fern Grows), including the fictional novel that begins to cause the main source of all the character's problems, Old Shep, My Pal. The main plot revolves around a play based on Old Shep where the ending has been changed to let the dog live.
