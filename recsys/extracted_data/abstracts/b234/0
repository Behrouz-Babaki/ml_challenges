Ang mga Kaibigan ni Mama Susan (Mama Susan's Friends) is a 2010 mystery novel by Filipino writer Bob Ong published in 2010 by Visprint Inc. It is Ong's eighth book, and his first attempt in the horror/suspense genre.The story revolves around Gilberto P. Manansala (Galo), a college student in an unnamed university in Manila, and his journal entries that he writes for one of his college instructors. In the entries he describes how his everyday situations turn into scary situations, how he uncovers various mysteries and horrors, and how he gets deeply involved in these mysteries and horrors and, in the end, cannot escape them.Some reviews of the book say that the pace is monotonous; however, it does pick up in the end and cryptic Latin messages embedded in Galo's journal entries add a sense of mystery to the story.â†’" O rex ac regina mundi potentissimi, qui nos vi infinita regitis, vos qui matri nostrae potestatem potentiamque quibus corda mentes animas nostrum regamus attribuistis, auxilium vestrum, di magni atque immortales, precamur. Arcete inimicos fidei nostrae nobis. Protegite domus nostras, fundos nostros, pagum nostrum a mutandi evertendique viribus." Some of Mama susan's ritual prayer.It has become a best seller, ranking first at most book stores in the Philippines.[citation needed]
