Ralph the Heir is a novel by Anthony Trollope, originally published in 1871. Although Trollope described it as "one of the worst novels I have written",it was well received by contemporary critics.More recently, readers have found it noteworthy for its account of a corrupt Parliamentary election,an account based closely on Trollope's own experience as a candidate.
