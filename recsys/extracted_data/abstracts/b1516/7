La Blue Girl (淫獣学園 La☆Blue Girl, Injū Gakuen La Blue Girl, roughly "Lewd Beast Academy: La Blue Girl") is an erotic anime and manga series.Based on the manga by Toshio Maeda, the La Blue Girl anime, like his other hentai series (e.g., Urotsukidōji), features a large amount of tentacle rape. It departs somewhat from its predecessors, however, by lightening the atmosphere with humor, lightly parodying the "Tentacle Hentai" genre. An immensely successful series, La Blue Girl has inspired, over the years, several OVA series for a total of 14 episodes, a comic book adaptation, three live-action movies, some PC games and some art-books.
