The Lollipop Shoes (retitled The Girl with No Shadow in the U.S.) is a 2007 novel by Joanne Harris and is a sequel to the best-selling Chocolat. Set between Hallowe'en and Christmas, it continues the story of the chocolate-making witch, Vianne Rocher, and her two young daughters, Anouk and Rosette. After leaving Lansquenet-sous-Tannes, Vianne has been living in the Montmartre quarter of Paris for the past four years. She has forsaken magic to live a normal life, and is quietly resigned to having lost her identity. However, just as she is about to make the terrible mistake of marrying a man she does not love just for the sake of respectability, she is befriended by the mysterious and free-spirited Zozie de l'Alba, who turns her life - and Anouk's - upside down.Darker than Chocolat and more openly mystical, the story is told in the first person from the three viewpoints of Vianne, Zozie and Anouk, indicated by the three icons: a sun, a black cat and a crescent moon.
